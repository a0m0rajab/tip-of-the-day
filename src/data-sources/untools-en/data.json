That may not always explicit or immediately visible.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>The thermostat is a very practical example of a balancing feedback loop. It monitors the temperature in a room (the actual level) and when it goes below or above a certain threshold (the desired level), it will start to heat or cool the room to keep the temperature within the thresholds.</p><figure data-asset-id=\"fcb51882-b31a-4ebe-a554-a89f01a6ced7\" data-image-id=\"fcb51882-b31a-4ebe-a554-a89f01a6ced7\"><img src=\"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/c6e42f10-0ed4-0062-585c-b740aa1ad46c/75482759-52f3-441f-a24b-465775cee162/balancing-loop-example.png\" data-asset-id=\"fcb51882-b31a-4ebe-a554-a89f01a6ced7\" data-image-id=\"fcb51882-b31a-4ebe-a554-a89f01a6ced7\" alt=\"Thermostat as an example of a balancing feedback loop\"></figure><p>In this case, the whole loop is intentional and the corrective action is designed. You will also find many natural balancing loops. Take the cooling of tea for example. When you make tea and leave it be, it will gradually cool down from its initially high temperature (the actual level) until it reaches the room temperature (the desired level). In this case, the corrective action would be the heat transfer between the tea and the air around. This will happen naturally, there's no intention behind it.</p><h2>Takeaway</h2><p>Balancing feedback loops seek to stabilize systems. They trigger corrective actions to reach a certain goal – they're self-correcting.</p><p>They are the opposite of the <a data-item-id=\"82b320ff-d4fb-4ba0-89ce-49f7072b8262\" href=\"\">reinforcing feedback loops</a>, which produce exponential changes.</p>",

We know they've been complaining about too many bugs in the product and slow response times from our support (as customers create more support tickets). At the same time, we've been shipping more features to make them happier. Let's use make a connection circle so that we can make sense of this.</p><p>From this story, we can identify the key elements: unhappy customers, bugs in the product, response times, support tickets and new features. We'll document them around our connection circle:</p><figure data-asset-id=\"5e3aa310-c201-42e7-8350-811db3ee81bb\" data-image-id=\"5e3aa310-c201-42e7-8350-811db3ee81bb\"><img src=\"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/c6e42f10-0ed4-0062-585c-b740aa1ad46c/bcee1beb-ed32-4e37-ab91-4c440bac0850/connection-circle-example.png\" data-asset-id=\"5e3aa310-c201-42e7-8350-811db3ee81bb\" data-image-id=\"5e3aa310-c201-42e7-8350-811db3ee81bb\" alt=\"Creating a connection circle: identifying key elements\"></figure><p>Now we need to document the relationships between them. For example, we know that unhappy customers create more support tickets. More tickets means longer response time which in turn produces even more unhappy customers. We try to ship new features which lower the number of unhappy customers. But they also produce more bugs and those lead to more unhappy customers again. Let's map these relationships to the connection circle:</p><figure data-asset-id=\"547bc687-e1f7-4b0a-b0df-050b0e7ba4b4\" data-image-id=\"547bc687-e1f7-4b0a-b0df-050b0e7ba4b4\"><img src=\"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/c6e42f10-0ed4-0062-585c-b740aa1ad46c/5a62ea88-8f09-492a-9af2-c348cbe2b42d/connection-circle-example%E2%80%931.png\" data-asset-id=\"547bc687-e1f7-4b0a-b0df-050b0e7ba4b4\" data-image-id=\"547bc687-e1f7-4b0a-b0df-050b0e7ba4b4\" alt=\"Creating a connection circle: mapping relationships in the sytem\"></figure><p>The connection circle is now nicely showing the key elements of the system and the relationships between them. There's even one feedback loop that we can see here:</p><figure data-asset-id=\"8570cd80-9cf4-4d7d-9b2c-8277bcbac0f9\" data-image-id=\"8570cd80-9cf4-4d7d-9b2c-8277bcbac0f9\"><img src=\"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/c6e42f10-0ed4-0062-585c-b740aa1ad46c/f12d6d71-56ea-4e3d-9d4e-d8b5812aec50/connection-circle-example%E2%80%93feedback-loop.png\" data-asset-id=\"8570cd80-9cf4-4d7d-9b2c-8277bcbac0f9\" data-image-id=\"8570cd80-9cf4-4d7d-9b2c-8277bcbac0f9\" alt=\"Creating a connection circle: identifying a feedback loop.\"></figure><p>The completed connection circle and an identified feedback loop make you better understand the system.

      "content": "<p>Some decisions can be tough to make. Especially when there are more factors that go into making them. Decision matrix is a tool that will help you consider all the important factors when making a decision. It brings more clarity into the process.</p><p>It is most useful when you have several options and you need to decide between them based on a number of different factors.</p><h2>How to use it&nbsp;</h2><p>Decision matrix is basically a simple table with your options and factors for deciding. The goal is to calculate a score for each option based on their factor scores. The score will help you make your decision.</p><p>Here's how to create a decision matrix step by step:</p><ol>  <li>Write down the decision you need to make</li>  <li>List the options you have</li>  <li>Identify factors that you want to consider</li>  <li>Score the options on each factor</li>  <li>Add weight to the factors</li>  <li>Calculate the options' scores – multiply each score by the factor weight, then add them up.</li>  <li>Pick your winner – option with the highest score</li></ol><p>Let's see how this works in practice.</p><h2>Practical example</h2><p>Suppose you're leading a design team and you want to decide which design tool you want to use as a team. You've done some research and you narrowed down your options to three: Sketch, Figma and Framer. Let's put them in your decision matrix table.</p><table><tbody>  <tr><td><strong>Factors</strong></td><td>TBD</td><td>TBD</td><td>TBD</td><td><strong>Score</strong></td></tr>  <tr><td><strong><sub>Weights</sub></strong></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Sketch</td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Figma</td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Framer</td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now let's look at the factors you need to consider. You have a set budget for tools so cost will be the first factor. After discussing with your team, you agree that prototyping and collaboration capabilities of a tool are most important for them. Now you have the factors that will influence the decision.</p><table><tbody>  <tr><td><strong>Factors</strong></td><td>Cost</td><td>Prototyping</td><td>Collaboration</td><td><strong>Score</strong></td></tr>  <tr><td><strong><sub>Weights</sub></strong></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Sketch</td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Figma</td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Framer</td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>It's time to score each option on every factor. Let's use a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 is the worst, 5 is the best), but you can use any scale you like.</p><p><strong>Cost</strong> – You find out that Figma and Framer both cost $12/editor/month, while Sketch is a little cheaper at $9. You'll score them 3 and 4 respectively.</p><p><strong>Prototyping </strong>– Framer comes out as the most powerful in prototyping. Figma and Sketch are somewhat similar, but Figma can do a little more. Framer gets a 5, Figma a 3 and Sketch a 2.</p><p><strong>Collaboration </strong>– You let your team evaluate this one. They agree that Figma is the best for collaboration, scoring it with 5. Sketch and Framer both get a 3.</p><p>Let's see how these look like in your decision matrix:</p><table><tbody>  <tr><td><strong>Factors</strong></td><td>Cost</td><td>Prototyping</td><td>Collaboration</td><td><strong>Score</strong></td></tr>  <tr><td><strong><sub>Weights</sub></strong></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Sketch</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Figma</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Framer</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>At this point, the decision might be a little clearer, but all factors aren't equally important. You need to add weight to them. Since your budget is set, the cost factor is the most important, making it a 5. Your team says that prototyping is a little more important for them than collaboration features. You weight the factors accordingly:</p><table><tbody>  <tr><td><strong>Factors</strong></td><td>Cost</td><td>Prototyping</td><td>Collaboration</td><td><strong>Score</strong></td></tr>  <tr><td><strong><sub>Weights</sub></strong></td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Sketch</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Figma</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Framer</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The next step is multiplying the scores with the weight of each factor. Score on each factor then adds up to a final score for every option:</p><table><tbody>  <tr><td><strong>Factors</strong></td><td>Cost</td><td>Prototyping</td><td>Collaboration</td><td><strong>Score</strong></td></tr>  <tr><td><strong><sub>Weights</sub></strong></td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td><br></td></tr>  <tr><td>Sketch</td><td>4*5 = 20</td><td>2*4 = 8</td><td>3*3 = 9</td><td><strong>37</strong></td></tr>  <tr><td>Figma</td><td>3*5 = 15</td><td>3*4 = 12</td><td>5*3 = 15</td><td><strong>42</strong></td></tr>  <tr><td>Framer</td><td>3*5 = 15</td><td>5*4 = 20</td><td>3*3 = 9</td><td><strong>44</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>And there you have it. You have a score for each option based on the factors that are important for you. In this case, Framer comes out as the winner.</p><p>Decision matrix is a very useful tool for situations like this. When there are multiple factors to consider, this tools removes the uncertainty and subjectivity from your decision-making. It allows you to clearly figure out which decision is the most reasonable to make.</p><h2>App for the decision matrix</h2><p>If you want to give this tool a shot, I recommend using an app called <a href=\"https://www.ruminate.io/\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ruminate</a>.

Collectively exhaustive means they cover the whole problem.</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Do not go into the small details (specific hypotheses): focus on capturing the broad categories that make up the problem.</li>  <li>Apply the 80/20 rule: focus on the few parts of the problem that are most impactful.    <ul>      <li>This is best to base on data, rather than your own hypotheses.&nbsp;</li>    </ul>  </li></ol><h3>Solution tree</h3><p>When you have singled out some specific parts of the problem that you want to focus on, you can follow up with creating a solution tree.</p><ol>  <li>Take the problem part you want to focus on and ask \"How might we improve/fix this?\"</li>  <li>Map out potential categories of the solution</li>  <li>Generate ideas within each category</li></ol><p>The advantage of this structured way of thinking is that working with constraints will actually help you generate more ideas.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Let's see an example of creating an issue tree.

Applying this ladder consciously allows you to take a step back and see where you're jumping to conclusions.</p><h2>How to use it</h2><p>Whenever you make a conclusion about something or are making decisions based on your conclusions, it's good to stop and question your reasoning.</p><figure data-asset-id=\"b87ad376-348d-4b5b-bafc-5fa18e6b9d52\" data-image-id=\"b87ad376-348d-4b5b-bafc-5fa18e6b9d52\"><img src=\"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/c6e42f10-0ed4-0062-585c-b740aa1ad46c/157f3003-8249-4b7f-8568-17dc97febf6c/ladder-of-inference-illustration.png\" data-asset-id=\"b87ad376-348d-4b5b-bafc-5fa18e6b9d52\" data-image-id=\"b87ad376-348d-4b5b-bafc-5fa18e6b9d52\" alt=\"The Ladder of Inference\"></figure><p>First, identify on which step of the ladder you currently are. Are you about to take action and you're not sure if it's the right one? Or perhaps you're aware of some of the assumptions you're making?</p><p>Then work your way down before building your reasoning up again. To work your way down the ladder, use these guiding questions for each step:</p><ul>  <li>Actions:    <ul>      <li>Why do I believe this to be the right action? What are some alternative options?</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Beliefs:    <ul>      <li>What beliefs do I hold about this? What conclusions are they based on?</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Conclusions:    <ul>      <li>Why did I conclude this? What are my assumptions there?</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Assumptions:    <ul>      <li>Are my assumptions valid? Why am I assuming this?&nbsp;</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Interpretations:    <ul>      <li>Am I looking at this data objectively? What other meanings could they have?</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Selected data:    <ul>      <li>What did I ignore or didn't pay attention to? Are there other sources of data I didn't consider?</li>    </ul>  </li></ul><p>As you answer these, you may find that your reasoning changes along the way and that's good. When you reach the bottom of the ladder, work your way back up again, this time more consciously and deliberately.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>Let's see how applying the ladder of inference looks like on a practical example.</p><p>Suppose I'm managing a team of developers. One of them hasn't been performing well recently. He's been missing deadlines and several projects were delayed because of this. I conclude he's not cut out for the job and decide to fire him.</p><p>However, I stop and ask myself: Is this the right thing to do? I can now apply the ladder of inference to unpack my thinking and perhaps make a better decision. I ask myself the guiding questions:</p><ul>  <li>Why do I believe that firing this person is the right action? Because it's clear to me he's not right for the job.</li>  <li>What conclusions is this belief based on? That he's not a good developer.</li>  <li>What are my assumptions here? I assumed that his recent results are representative of his qualities (or lack thereof).</li>  <li>Why am I assuming this? Because missed deadlines mean he's not efficient.</li>  <li>What other meanings could the data I'm looking at have? Missed deadlines might also mean the deadlines are unreasonable or he's taking extra time to deliver quality code.</li>  <li>Are there other sources of data I didn't consider? I haven't asked him directly yet. When I do, I might find out the real reason he's been missing deadlines.</li></ul><p>This is a simplified example but it shows the kind of jumping to conclusions I want to avoid: <em>missed deadlines → inefficient → not a good developer → should be fired</em>. By unpacking my thinking, I can look at the situation more objectively and I may discover different reasons for what's happening: perhaps the deadlines are too tight or he's going through some personal issues. Neither of which should be a reason to fire him.</p><p>The ladder of influence has just helped me avoid making a bad and premature decision.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Different situations typically require different responses. The Cynefin framework (pronounced /kəˈnɛvɪn/ - \"kuh-nev-in\") is there to help you make sense of the situation in front of you and make a decision that's appropriate for the type of situation you're dealing with. It was developer by Dave Snowden in 1999.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to use it</h2><p>The framework identifies five domains to categorize problems or situations: obvious, complicated, complex, chaotic and disorder.</p><p>The idea is to <strong>identify which domain you're in and then choose the appropriate action based on its characteristics</strong>. So let's look at each domain in detail.</p><figure data-asset-id=\"bbd9392e-4110-44f6-a3b4-d7bce9e879ad\" data-image-id=\"bbd9392e-4110-44f6-a3b4-d7bce9e879ad\"><img src=\"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/c6e42f10-0ed4-0062-585c-b740aa1ad46c/155e1f3f-f05c-4673-b562-75c682207524/Cynefin_as_of_1st_June_2014.png\" data-asset-id=\"bbd9392e-4110-44f6-a3b4-d7bce9e879ad\" data-image-id=\"bbd9392e-4110-44f6-a3b4-d7bce9e879ad\" alt=\"Cynefin framework by Dave Snowden\"></figure><h3>Obvious</h3><p>Also known as clear or simple, this is the domain of best practices. This is where problems are familiar and clearly defined, cause-and-effect relationships are clear and the situations are stable. Many process-oriented situations and problems would fall into this domain. It's a domain of \"known knowns\".</p><p>Solutions are usually obvious in these situations and don't require much expertise. &nbsp;</p><p>The right approach would be <em>sense–categorise–respond</em>: understand the situation (sense), categorize it, then respond by applying a best-practice solution.</p><h3>Complicated</h3><p>In this domain, there might be multiple right answers but aren't immediately visible. It's a domain of \"known unknowns\" – when questions are clear but it takes work to answer them.</p><p>That's why the best approach is to <em>sense-analyze-respond</em>. Because analysis is needed, the situations here typically require expert knowledge. Experts should assess the situation, investigate possible options and choose a course of action.</p><h3>Complex</h3><p>In this domain, there are \"unknown unknowns\". The situation cannot be understood by analysis because we don't yet know enough about it. It's not clear what needs to be answered in the first place.</p><p>So the right approach is to experiment first, learn about the problem. Then sense what you're dealing with and respond appropriately. The goal should be to understand enough so that the problem or situation moves to the complicated domain where it's easier to deal with.</p><h3>Chaotic</h3><p>When things aren't under control, the situation falls into the chaotic domain. It's when cause and effect relationships are unclear. Here it's necessary to first act to establish some stability, to contain the situation. Only then assess the situation and work on bringing enough order to it to move it into the complex domain. Act–sense–respond.</p><p>The chaotic domain also presents an opportunity to try novel solutions as people might be more open to them in this context.</p><h3>Disorder</h3><p>If you don't know where you stand, you're in the disorder domain. The goal should be to quickly identify the right domain and move forward from there. It can be helpful to break down the problem or situation into multiple parts and assign each to a specific domain.</p><h2>Determining which domain you're in</h2><p>It's best to get more familiar with each domain to learn when characteristics of a problem/situation apply to a particular domain. The sources below are a good place to start.</p><p>Here's a set of questions that can also help point you to the right domain:</p><ul>  <li>Do you know what causes the situation?</li>  <li>Is the situation under control?</li>  <li>How much do you know about it?</li>  <li>Does solving it require expert knowledge?</li></ul><h2>Takeaway</h2><p>The key idea of the Cynefin framework is that <strong>different kinds of situations or problems require different kinds of responses</strong>. You should identify what kind of a situation you're dealing with and—with the help of this framework—choose an appropriate response.</p>",
